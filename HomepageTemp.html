<h1> Milestone 1 </h1>

<h2>Who are the target users? Who are not the target users? Why is this an appropriate target group?</h2>
 
The target users are people with mental health disorders/problems such as anxiety, PTSD, depression, and other issues. Additionally, this web service will also provide support for those users whose families have a history of these issues and they themselves could be prone to mental health issues. People who do not have any connection to any kind of mental health disorders are not the target audience for this app but they are welcome to use it to alleviate stress in their lives. This is an appropriate target group because our app can help people with these disorders and people in their family to find help and to feel better.

<h2>
An overview of what the solution will do and why it's needed
</h2>
 
This solution will provide a platform for people struggling from these mental health problems. The platform will provide resources and a support system for these people to visit and receive the help that they need. This solution is needed because there should be a place where people with mental health disorders can go to in order to find helpful resources, important information, and a chat bot to talk to for support. People struggling with mental illnesses often feel isolated and alone in their struggles, so this service will help let them know that there are others dealing with the same struggles.

Task analysis
A description of the important characteristics of the tasks performed by users.
 
Are these mobile users, desktop users, people in the library, etc?
</h2>
=
The platform should be readily available to anyone at any time, so the users will range from mobile to desktop users.

<h2>
What geographic area are the users in? How does this impact them?
</h2>

The users of our web services are not based in any particular geographical area and therefore our web service will be available to anyone from any location. However, we do expect seasonal increases in usage, specifically during the winter months as a result of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). SAD may begin at any age, but it typically starts when a person is between ages 18 and 30 according to the American Psychiatric Association1.

<h2>
What is the age range of the users? Does that impact things?
</h2>

Ages 13+ 
This allows for more mature and realistic content regarding the difficulties involved with mental health
According to an article by huffpost, approximately 60% of adults, and almost 50% of youth, ages 8 -15, with a mental illness received no mental health services in the previous year2. Our web service can help with this by providing people with an anonymous place where they can get help or be directed to further resources for help. 

<h2>
Implications of economic standing
</h2>

Our website is non-profit, free to use with no advertising. We hope to provide services to anyone with access to the internet. 

<h2> 
A description of important characteristics of the task environment.
</h2>

Low income individuals without easy access to the internet will need to go to public areas such as a library to access our website. This environment would be difficult for users to reach.
Other users with easier internet access such as smartphone or personal computer will be able to access our website in any environment they feel comfortable.

Upon first look, it is noticeable that this website has clear sources for immediate help on the landing page. However, some of these links look like advertisements and may be overlooked by user’s who are first visiting the website.
The landing page of the website also does not seem very appealing or comforting to users, so our website will need to be more visually and aesthetically appealing. This can be accomplished through the use of a better color scheme and less cluttered page.

The website has a menu option where they can see all the disorders that they support and that users can get help with. The users can click on these links to find more information about the disorder. When we are implementing our website, we will have information available on the disorder, where to get help, other helpful resources, and a link to a chat room on the website so that they can talk to other people who are struggling with the same thing.
