    <h1> Milestone 1 </h1>

    <h2>Who are the target users? Who are not the target users? Why is this an appropriate target group?</h2>
     
    <p>
    The target users are people with mental health disorders/problems such as anxiety, PTSD, depression, and other issues. Additionally, this web service will also provide support for those users whose families have a history of these issues and they themselves could be prone to mental health issues. People who do not have any connection to any kind of mental health disorders are not the target audience for this app but they are welcome to use it to alleviate stress in their lives. This is an appropriate target group because our app can help people with these disorders and people in their family to find help and to feel better. </br></br> For our web service this would mean that we would use colors that are not dull but still make the user feel calm. It would also mean that we would provide many resources so that people can find help for themselves or when dealing with or helping thier friends and family.
    </p>

    <h2>
    An overview of what the solution will do and why it's needed
    </h2>
    
    <p>
    This solution will provide a platform for people struggling from these mental health problems. The platform will provide resources and a support system for these people to visit and receive the help that they need. This solution is needed because there should be a place where people with mental health disorders can go to in order to find helpful resources, important information, and a chat bot to talk to for support. People struggling with mental illnesses often feel isolated and alone in their struggles, so this service will help let them know that there are others dealing with the same struggles.

    <h2>Task analysis
    </br>A description of the important characteristics of the tasks performed by users.
    </br>Are these mobile users, desktop users, people in the library, etc?</h2>

    <p>
    The platform should be readily available to anyone at any time, so the users will range from mobile to desktop users. The users will need to be able to access the internet though in order to get to the website. Once they are on the website, they can use any of the features without having to log into thier account so that they can remain anonymous while finding help and support through our website.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What geographic area are the users in? How does this impact them?</h2>

    <p>
    Our website is currently in English but users will be able to choose different languages based on what language they speak. Articles that show up when they look for help will be in the language that they choose. The users of our web services are not based in any particular geographical area and therefore our web service will be available to anyone from any location. However, we do expect seasonal increases in usage, specifically during the winter months as a result of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). SAD may begin at any age, but it typically starts when a person is between ages 18 and 30 according to the American Psychiatric Association1. Because we provide help to people from all geographical areas, users will be able to find doctors and therapists in thier area if they give their location. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>What is the age range of the users? Does that impact things?</h2>

    <p>
    Ages 13+ 
    This allows for more mature and realistic content regarding the difficulties involved with mental health
    According to an article by huffpost, approximately 60% of adults, and almost 50% of youth, ages 8 -15, with a mental illness received no mental health services in the previous year(2). Our web service can help with this by providing people with an anonymous place where they can get help or be directed to further resources for help. 
    </p>

    <h2>Implications of economic standing</h2>

    <p>
    Our website is non-profit, free to use with no advertising. We hope to provide services to anyone with access to the internet. 
    </p>

    <h2> A description of important characteristics of the task environment.</h2>

    <p>
    Low income individuals without easy access to the internet will need to go to public areas such as a library to access our website. This environment would be difficult for users to reach.
    Other users with easier internet access such as smartphone or personal computer will be able to access our website in any environment they feel comfortable. Our project will be a web service so that people have easier access to it compared to just a mobile app. If it were just a mobile app, then the app would be limited to only those with a phone. By making it a web service, we are allowing more users to find help as long as they have access to the internet.

    Upon first look, it is noticeable that this website has clear sources for immediate help on the landing page. However, some of these links look like advertisements and may be overlooked by user’s who are first visiting the website.
    The landing page of the website also does not seem very appealing or comforting to users, so our website will need to be more visually and aesthetically appealing. This can be accomplished through the use of a better color scheme and less cluttered page.
    </br>
    </br>
    <img src="HCI_gov_pic2.PNG"></br>
    The website has a menu option where they can see all the disorders that they support and that users can get help with. The users can click on these links to find more information about the disorder. When we are implementing our website, we will have information available on the disorder, where to get help, other helpful resources, and a link to a chat room on the website so that they can talk to other people who are struggling with the same thing.
    </p>

    <h2>Implications for our website and what we have learned</h2>
    <p>
      We have done a lot of research on the problem that are app is addressing and the existing solutions to help people. Overall, we have learned that mental health is important, and we can provide people with help on finding information about certain mental disorders. There is a large amount of people who have experienced from various kinds of mental disorders but not many of these people received professional help for it. We think that by providing helpful resources to these people, we can encourage them to get help if they need it and how they can get help. We also learned that being anonymous can aide people get the help that they need. Families of people with mental health disorders also deserve a place where they can go to in order to understand what their families are going through.
      </br></br>
      After all the research that we have done on the existing solutions, we have learned a few things about what we want to implement for our web service. We want to make sure that the user has access to immediate help if they need it. We think that this is important and should not be difficult for the user to find. They should also have access to information about doctors and therapists in the area so that if they think they need to see a doctor, they can find a specialist that can address what they are facing specifically located in their area. They should also have access to how much the doctor visit will cost and how they can find affordable resources because everyone should be able to get easy access to mental health care no matter how much money they make.
      </br></br>
      Another key feature that we think is important in our web service is group chat rooms where people can get support from other people also in similar situations. These groups are important because people who have specific mental disorders can know that they are not alone and that there are other people who understand what they are going through. These support rooms can also be there for families of people who have mental disorder so that they know how other people are supporting their friends and families.
      </br></br>
      Although there are many existing solutions and places for help for people who have mental disorders, we think that our solution is unique because people can find help with resources that have information about various disorders and they can also talk to other people who are going through the same thing. All this help is in one location which will make it easier for people to not be overwhelmed by all the information that comes up on the internet when they just do a google search.
