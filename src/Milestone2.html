    During our first meeting for Milestone 2, We brainstormed different design solutions for our integrated chat idea. We settled on Chat Rooms, Chat Bot, and Audio Chatrooms as our three designs to prototype via storyboards.

    We started our second meeting for Milestone 2 with a teambuilding exercise with one team member drawing a visualization of an image the rest of the team described. 
	    
	   </br></br> We proceeded to create a list describing the functionality of each of the three design implementations. 
	   </br></br> Next, we started by hand drawing our storyboard panels. We realized that this approach would take too long and copying them would be difficult. So instead, we moved to using the Figma modeling software to make our storyboard panels.

    <h2>Story Board 1: Chat Rooms Design</h2>

      </br> Justification: The Chat Room Design is the best way to implement user communication in our web app because text-based communication is the most familiar to the user. This makes the user feel comfortable and increases the chances of it being used. The design is also simple enough for the user to locate their respective chat room. Once in the chat room, the user can share anything they would like while still being anonymous. 
 </br></br> Benefits:
  </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This design is familiar to the users as text based communication is something they are more used to interacting with 
  </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Chat rooms will be personal enough for the user to feel like they’re receiving useful information but maintain enough anonymity to encourage them to keep using the service 
  </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There will be more tangible information being shared by many individuals, increasing the chances of changing the lives of users 
 </br></br> Negatives:
  </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There’s less control over the information that is shared in the group chats 
  </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A user might have a hard time choosing a chat room since there are many options
  </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It could be complicated to admin many chat rooms

      </br>Justification - The chatbot design provides extreme ease of use to users. The bot is only one click away at any time via the button in the banner, which is valuable given the target demographic for this service. Additionally, the bot provides complete anonymity to people. There is no need to worry that another person could possibly identify you as you will be chatting with a bot rather than other users on the site.
    </br></br>Benefits: 
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Complete anonymity
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Your conversations are between you and the bot, nobody else has to know
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Easy to use and understand
</br></br> Negatives:
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Can feel impersonal talking to a robot
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp May not fulfill the desire of venting to a real person
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The bot may not be able to understand some user entries

    <p>
     </br> Justification: 
     </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The purpose of interactions between users is to give them a sense that they are not alone and that there are others out there who are experiencing the same kind of thing. With a text chat/chatbot option, it can feel more “fake”. With an audio chat design, users can get more real interactions with people. Oftentimes, people just need someone to talk to and vent, and this is more easily accomplished with audio chat. Users do not have to transcribe their thoughts but rather just speak what they’re feeling. This option is fairly easy to navigate to, users just need to select a certain chat room. After that, they just talk. There’s no need to worry about typing or scrolling to see what others have said.

	</br></br> Benefits:
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp More intimate and real interactions with other people
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Quicker and more authentic conversation
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Better for “emergency” scenarios
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Can help address a user’s issue by analyzing the conversation

	</br></br> Negatives:
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Less anonymous and potentially unsafe, harder to moderate
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Requires a microphone 
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp No history of the chat as it is all spoken, can not go back to see how people responded.
