    During our first meeting for Milestone 2, We brainstormed different design solutions for our integrated chat idea. We settled on Chat Rooms, Chat Bot, and Audio Chatrooms as our three designs to prototype via storyboards.

    We started our second meeting for Milestone 2 with a teambuilding exercise with one team member drawing a visualization of an image the rest of the team described. 
	    
	   </br></br> We proceeded to create a list describing the functionality of each of the three design implementations. 
	   </br></br> Next, we started by hand drawing our storyboard panels. We realized that this approach would take too long and copying them would be difficult. So instead, we moved to using the Figma modeling software to make our storyboard panels.

	    </br> Chat Room Storyboard:
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Slide 1: Santiago arrives at the feelgoodinc website where he immediately sees the “Chat Rooms” button and clicks on it
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Slide 2: Santiago is then taken to a page where he sees a list of different support chat rooms he can join. He clicks on the “Depression” support chat room
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Slide 3: Santiago arrives at the chat room where he is able to see all the messages that have been sent. There are also two buttons under the text-box: one button to exit the chat room and one to navigate to the resources page 
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Slide 4: As part of the chat room, Santiago can provide support to other users or ask for support by texting in the chat 
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Slide 5: Santiago can then use the “Exit Chat Room” button to leave the chat room and navigate to the page with the list of other chat rooms
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Slide 6: Clicking this link will take Santiago to the page with other chat rooms. He can choose any other chat room to join    
      
</br></br> Justification: The Chat Room Design is the best way to implement user communication in our web app because text-based communication is the most familiar to the user. This makes the user feel comfortable and increases the chances of it being used. The design is also simple enough for the user to locate their respective chat room. Once in the chat room, the user can share anything they would like while still being anonymous. 
 </br></br> Benefits:
  </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This design is familiar to the users as text based communication is something they are more used to interacting with 
  </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Chat rooms will be personal enough for the user to feel like they’re receiving useful information but maintain enough anonymity to encourage them to keep using the service 
  </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There will be more tangible information being shared by many individuals, increasing the chances of changing the lives of users 
 </br></br> Negatives:
  </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There’s less control over the information that is shared in the group chats 
  </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A user might have a hard time choosing a chat room since there are many options
  </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It could be complicated to admin many chat rooms

	    </br>Chatbot storyboard:
	</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Slide 1: Dave goes to feelgoodinc website. He moves the mouse over the “chatbot” button in the banner.
	</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Slide 2: Dave clicks the button in the banner, and is taken to the page with the chatbot. A message is displayed to provide a place for the conversation to begin.
	</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Slide 3: The conversation progresses between Dave and the bot. The bot is keeping track of the contents of their conversation, so that it can provide links to helpful resources. 
	</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Slide 4: Links to resources the bot thinks could help Dave are provided. The conversation comes to a close
	</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Slide 5: The conversation comes to a close as David leaves the chatbot to look at the resources that the bot provided. 	
     
	</br></br>Justification - The chatbot design provides extreme ease of use to users. The bot is only one click away at any time via the button in the banner, which is valuable given the target demographic for this service. Additionally, the bot provides complete anonymity to people. There is no need to worry that another person could possibly identify you as you will be chatting with a bot rather than other users on the site.
    </br></br>Benefits: 
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Complete anonymity
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Your conversations are between you and the bot, nobody else has to know
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Easy to use and understand
</br></br> Negatives:
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Can feel impersonal talking to a robot
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp May not fulfill the desire of venting to a real person
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The bot may not be able to understand some user entries

	   </br>  Audio Call storyboard:
	</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Slide 1: Stacey navigates to the homepage of the website. She wants someone to talk to, so she hovers over the “Chat Room” selection.
	</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Slide 2: Stacey notices a variety of different chat rooms and the amount of people in them. She clicks on the “Bipolar” room.
	</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Slide 3: As she enters the room, “Loud Pineapple” is speaking about an event that happened this week with her bipolar disorder. Stacey only wants to listen for now, so she mutes her microphone.
	</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Slide 4: “Perfect Orange” chimes in with some advice for “Loud Pineapple”. After some time, even though Stacey did not speak, she feels better knowing that other people are experiencing the same thing and that they have been able to work through it.
	</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Slide 5: Stacey leaves the chat room, and is again taken to the list of available chat rooms.

     </br></br> Justification: 
     </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The purpose of interactions between users is to give them a sense that they are not alone and that there are others out there who are experiencing the same kind of thing. With a text chat/chatbot option, it can feel more “fake”. With an audio chat design, users can get more real interactions with people. Oftentimes, people just need someone to talk to and vent, and this is more easily accomplished with audio chat. Users do not have to transcribe their thoughts but rather just speak what they’re feeling. This option is fairly easy to navigate to, users just need to select a certain chat room. After that, they just talk. There’s no need to worry about typing or scrolling to see what others have said.

	</br></br> Benefits:
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp More intimate and real interactions with other people
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Quicker and more authentic conversation
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Better for “emergency” scenarios
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Can help address a user’s issue by analyzing the conversation

	</br></br> Negatives:
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Less anonymous and potentially unsafe, harder to moderate
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Requires a microphone 
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp No history of the chat as it is all spoken, can not go back to see how people responded.
