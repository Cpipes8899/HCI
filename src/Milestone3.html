<h2>Initial evaluation/testing plan</h2>
<p>
1. Benchmark tasks
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a. ensure that both user groups (especially the mentally ill) can find and use the “get immediate help” button on navbar quickly and without issues . 
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp b. Ensure that both user groups can locate information based on the illness they wish to learn about
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp c. User can find help near them
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp d. User can talk to a Chat Bot to feel better
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp e. User can search for links on the internet using the search bar
</br>2. Subjective Questions (all of these are from 1 (bad) to 5 (great))
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a. I found this website useful
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp b. I found this website calming
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp c. I found this website easy to navigate
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp d. I felt that using this website was intuitive 
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp e. I felt intimidated by this website
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp f. We might also use questionnaires like the Questionnaire for User Interface Satisfaction(QUIS) or the “System usability scale” questionnaire.  
</br>3. Interview questions - Before 
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a. Have you ever used online mental health services before? If so, how was your experience with it? 
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp b. Would you be comfortable using a website to get help if your identity remains anonymous?
</br>4. Interview questions - After 
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a. Any comments on the website? Just tell us your first impression.
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp b. Was there anything that stuck out to you as particularly well made or internesting.
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp c. Was there anything that stuck out to you as poorly designed or hard to use.
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp d. (If they had said they had used a mental health web service before) How does our website compare to the one you had used previously? Was there a feature that you feel is important that our website doesn’t have?
</br>5. Other evaluation techniques 
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a. We are having each user explore our entire website, and we only have one design (the within approach). Instead of using this approach, we could have made multiple designs and have different user groups test out these different designs (the between approach)
