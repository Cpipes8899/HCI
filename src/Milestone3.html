	    </br> Home Page:
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The homepage is the place where the user starts out on our website. From here they can easily access every other part of the website and they can also learn more about what the website can help them with. The homepage starts out with a calming image so that the users are not overwhelmed with a large section of text as soon as they get to the site. Underneath the picture, we have a section of text that informs the users of the various parts of the website so that they can navigate to where they need to go easily.

	    </br> Get Help Now:
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The get help now alert gives the user a kind message and gives them the phone number that they should call in order to get immediate help from a trained professional. All the user has to do in order to get help from any part of the website is click on the “Get Help Now” tab on the nav bar and a pop up will show up alerting the user. This tab is easy to locate, clear, and simple so that it does not confuse the user and gives then information in the quickest way possible.

	    </br> Informative Resources:
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The informative resources section is a dropdown on the navigation bar with 5 common mental disorders: anxiety and OCD, depression, PTSD, bipolar disorder, and Schizophrenia. This allows the user to learn more about what they are going through. <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp These pages have three sections: Support, Financial help, and helpful organizations. The Support section provides the user with links to information about the disorder and links to support groups. The Financial help section helps the user look through links that can help them manage the cost of medication and therapy. The organizations sections gives the users links to reputable organizations that can help the user get help with everything that they are going through. All these sections contain links to get help in one place so that the user is not overwhelmed about where to start when they are seeking out help.

    <h2>Help Near You</h2>

    <p>
	    
	    </br> Help Near You:
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The help near you section that can be access from the navigation bar lets the user enter in their zip code and then gives them a map and a list links to doctors and therapists near their location. This allows the user to find professional help outside of the website once they decide that they want or need it. Although this feature is not fully functional, the idea of this part is that the user can just provide a location and the website would filter results to give the user a list of places that they can go to in order to get professional help.

    <h2>Chat Bot</h2>

	    </br> Chat Bot:
</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The chat bot section that can be access through the navigation bar allows the user to talk to an AI that can help them work through their feelings and get help. This allows the user to express their feelings while remaining completely anonymous. The chat bot also gives the user links to helpful resources on the website once it understands what they user is going through of if they ask for help with a specific disorder. It provides calming messages to the user to make them feel a little better and encourages the user to get either professional help or resources that can help.

<h2>Initial evaluation/testing plan</h2>
<p>
    1. Benchmark tasks
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a. ensure that both user groups (especially the mentally ill) can find and use the “get
    immediate help” button on navbar quickly and without issues .
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp b. Ensure that both user groups can locate information based on the illness they wish to
    learn about
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp c. User can find help near them
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp d. User can talk to a Chat Bot to feel better
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp e. User can search for links on the internet using the search bar
</br></br>2. Subjective Questions (all of these are from 1 (bad) to 5 (great))
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a. I found this website useful
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp b. I found this website calming
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp c. I found this website easy to navigate
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp d. I felt that using this website was intuitive
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp e. I felt intimidated by this website
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp f. We might also use questionnaires like the Questionnaire for User Interface
    Satisfaction(QUIS) or the “System usability scale” questionnaire.
</br></br>3. Interview questions - Before
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a. Have you ever used online mental health services before? If so, how was your experience
    with it?
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp b. Would you be comfortable using a website to get help if your identity remains
    anonymous?
</br></br>4. Interview questions - After
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a. Any comments on the website? Just tell us your first impression.
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp b. Was there anything that stuck out to you as particularly well made or internesting.
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp c. Was there anything that stuck out to you as poorly designed or hard to use.
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp d. (If they had said they had used a mental health web service before) How does our
    website compare to the one you had used previously? Was there a feature that you feel is important that our website
    doesn’t have?
</br></br>5. Other evaluation techniques
    </br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a. We are having each user explore our entire website, and we only have one design (the
    within approach). Instead of using this approach, we could have made multiple designs and have different user groups
    test out these different designs (the between approach). Due to time and development constraints, as well as limited availability of users to test the site, we found it appropriate to use the within approach.
