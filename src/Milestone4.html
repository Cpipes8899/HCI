        </br><h2>Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
        <p>
        Show system status: 
        </br>The page that the user is on is clearly displayed. The section that they user is on is highlighted in the nav bar. The only one that does not get highlighted is the one for the informative resources because it is a dropdown, so the user has to click on a specific part in the dropdown to get to a page. Severity rating: 1
        </br></br>Familiar metaphors & language:
        </br>All the language in the website is clear for the user to understand. We wanted to make sure that the user does not get overwhelmed by any of the terms so we tried to make everything is easily understandable and concise. Severity rating: 0
        </br></br>Control & freedom:
        </br>If the users click the back button, they are taken to the web page that they were on previously since out website simply consists of web pages tied together. If the user clicks the back button when they are in the chat bot or from the help near you, the website will take them to the page that they were on previously, it will not retain the information from the user. Severity rating: 2
        </br></br>Consistency:
        </br>All the controls on the website are the same. When they click on any item in the nav bar it does to a different page. The only button on the nav-bar that functions differently from the others is the one that takes the users to informative resources which is a dropdown and that button looks different than the other ones so the users do expect it to act like the other buttons. Some of the buttons in the website do not match each other. Severity rating: 1
        </br></br>Error prevention:
        </br>The user does not have to input much data, so they do not have many chances to get an error. In the informative resources we have pre-set out mental disorders instead of allowing the users to type in a disorder to get information. In this way we can prevent user errors and if they want to look anything else up, they can look it up using the search feature. The users can also use the search feature using the button to find the keyword or clicking on the ‘Go’ button so that they can choose whichever method they are comfortable with and user to. Severity rating: 0
        </br></br>Recognition over recall:
        </br>We do not have anywhere in the website that requires the user to remember any information. Severity rating: 0
        </br></br>Flexibility & efficiency:
        </br>The user can easily to any page that they wish to go to in very little time. They do not need to perform any difficult tasks to get to any pages, they just have to click on the link the in the nav bar. The user however cannot use previously entered information. The previous conversations with the chat bot do not get saved so the users cannot see anything that they talked about with the chat bot once they leave the page. The map page also does not remember the zip code that the user enters so they have to put it in every time they go to and leave the page. Severity rating: 2
        </br></br>Aesthetic & minimalist design:
        </br>We tried to make the website look pleasing and not overwhelm the users as most of them are already stressed out, so we chose colors that are calming. The image on the homepage is also meant to calm the user and not stress them out. The design of the website is very minimalistic, and we tried to make sure nothing seemed too intense and nothing looked like an advertisement like some of the other website that we looked at. Everything ties in together and follows the same color scheme and we used bootstrap so that everything would look pleasing and connected at the same time. Severity rating: 0
        </br></br>Recognize, diagnose, & recover from errors:
        </br>We do not have anywhere in the website where the users can run into any errors, so we do not have anything that helps the user recover from errors. When the user does type in something that does not make sense, we do not have an error message that shows up to tell the user that what they put it does not make sense. Severity rating: 2
        </br></br>Help:
        </br>The user can access help about how to use the website and where everything is on the homepage and they can access the homepage from any other page on the website. The information about how to use the website is easy and clear to understand. Severity rating:0
